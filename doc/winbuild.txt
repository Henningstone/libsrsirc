Steps to build libsrsirc on Windows
===================================
- Tested on WinXP 32bit with MinGW 2013072200, MSYS 2013072200, libsrsirc 0.0.11


MinGW/MSYS setup (needs to be done just once)
---------------------------------------------
1. Download mingw-get-setup.exe (http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/)
2. Run it to install the MinGW/MSYS installation manager
   Installation directory: C:\MinGW
   [x] ...also install support for the graphical user interface
   (*) ...just for me
   Perform the installation.

3. In the MinGW installation manager (should open automatically, run
   C:\MinGW\libexec\mingw-get\guimain.exe if it doesn't), select
   "Basic Setup" on the left pane, mark "mingw32-base" and "msys-base"
   for installation.  Apply the changes using the menu.


libsrsirc build procedure
-------------------------
1. On a Unix-ish machine, create a distribution tarball the usual way
   (./autogen.sh && ./configure && make dist).
   Copy the tarball over to the Windows machine as C:\libsrsirc-$VERSION.tar.gz
   Copy scripts/winbuild.sh over to the Windows machine e.g. as C:\winbuild.sh
   (Note: If you want to use other directories, or if your MinGW isn't
   in C:\MinGW, edit the three variables at the top of winbuild.sh)

2. Run C:\MinGW\msys\1.0\msys.bat, to start a shell (bash)

3. Execute in that shell: sh /c/winbuild.sh [<version>] ['release']
   (version can be omitted if only one libsrsirc tarball sits in C:\,
   if 'release' is given, creates a tarbomb of the resulting binaries (exe+dll))
