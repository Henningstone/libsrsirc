This is libsrsirc, version 0.0.11
A lightweight, cross-platform IRC library
Written in portable standard C (C99)

Quickstart for libsrsirc users:
  - Get a release tarball off the "tar" branch, DO NOT use the
    github-internal "release" feature.
    I.e. use https://github.com/fstd/libsrsirc/tree/tar
    (use "view raw" for downloading)

  - Extract the tarball, cd into the resulting directory

  - run "./configure && make" to build the lib, "make install" to install.

Quickstart for libsrsirc developers:
  - Clone the repo

  - Run ./autogen.sh to setup the autohell.
    (This requires autoconf >= 2.69, automake >= 1.14, libtool >= 2.4)

  - run "./configure && make" to build the lib, "make install" to install.

  - To tear down the autohell, run ./autoclean.sh

See src/helloworld.c for a trivial example application of the lib.

See INSTALL for generic autohell compile/install instructions.

See COPYING for license information (tl;dr: 3-clause BSD)
