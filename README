This is libsrsirc, version 0.0.7
A lightweight IRC library

Quickstart:
run ./autogen.sh to setup the autohell
afterwards, usual ./configure ; make ; make install stuff applies

libsrsirc/irc.h is what you usually want to #include when using
  the lib, libsrsirc/irc_ext.h if you plan on using more than the
  very basics; libsrsirc/irc_util.h is useful, too.
  see src/icat.c for an example application of the lib.

See INSTALL for generic autohell compile/install instructions.
