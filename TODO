do libsrsirc's and icat's debug mechanisms collide/overlap?

theres a bug (might be a security loophole) in ircio_read() in irc_io.c
  this should be fuzz-tested

a general code cleanup is overdue

revise the autohell, i'm new to it and probably messed up
  also config.h isn't used anywhere lol

in dumb mode, should we handle 001-004 etc anyway?

tracking only works with servers that use 005 CASEMAPPING.
if skmap could rehash, tracking could be enabled
before connecting and hence we wouldn't depend on 005
