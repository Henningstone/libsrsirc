do libsrsirc's and icat's debug mechanisms collide/overlap?

in dumb mode, should we handle 001-004 etc anyway?

tracking only works with servers that use 005 CASEMAPPING.
if skmap could rehash, tracking could be enabled
before connecting and hence we wouldn't depend on 005

accessor for all 005 attributes

irc_cmodes -> irc_004chanmodes; then irc_cmodes dispatches to 004 or
005 depending on whether 005 was there.  how to handle classes tho?

Convenience functions for the typical client-issued commands
